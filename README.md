# Fashion-Recommendation

The Clothing Item Recommender is a machine learning model that takes text descriptions of clothing items as input and provides a ranked list of links to similar items from various websites. This repository contains the necessary code and instructions to train and deploy the recommender model.

Model Overview

The recommender model is built using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and employs a combination of text embeddings and similarity matching to find similar clothing items. It leverages a pre-trained language model to encode the text descriptions into high-dimensional representations. These representations are then compared using a similarity measure to rank the similarity between items.
