# Fashion-Recommendation

The Clothing Item Recommender is a machine learning model that takes text descriptions of clothing items as input and provides a ranked list of links to similar items from various websites. This repository contains the necessary code and instructions to train and deploy the recommender model.

Model Overview

The recommender model is built using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and employs a combination of text embeddings and similarity matching to find similar clothing items. It leverages a pre-trained language model to encode the text descriptions into high-dimensional representations. These representations are then compared using a similarity measure to rank the similarity between items.

Getting Started

To get started with the Clothing Item Recommender, follow the instructions below.

Pre-requisites

Python 3.7 or higher
pip package manager

Prepare the Dataset

The Dataset can be prepared by web scraping. I have used parsehub web scraping tool to scrap data from amazon . I have also manually scrapped limeroad data using requests and beautiful soup.After gathering data organize your clothing item dataset into a CSV file with two columns: description and url. The description column should contain text descriptions of the clothing items, and the url column should contain the corresponding URLs to the items' websites. Ensure that the dataset has a sufficient number of examples for accurate recommendations.

Clean the data:

Perform data cleaning operations to ensure the text data is in a suitable format for processing. Some common cleaning steps include:
1) Removing any unnecessary columns that are not required for training the recommender.
2) Handling missing values, if any. You can choose to drop rows with missing values or fill them with appropriate values.
3) Removing any special characters, punctuation, or HTML tags from the text data.
4) Converting the text to lowercase to ensure consistent processing.

 Feature Extraction

Convert the preprocessed text descriptions into numerical features that can be used by the machine learning model.One common approach is to use TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to represent each clothing item description as a vector of numerical features.Alternatively, you can use pre-trained word embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe to represent the text as dense vector representations.

Model Selection

Choose a suitable machine learning model for the task.For text similarity tasks, you can use cosine similarity or a nearest neighbor algorithm such as k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN).Another option is to use more advanced models like Siamese Networks or BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for better performance.

Ranking

Once your model is trained, you can use it to predict the most similar items for a given clothing description.Calculate the similarity scores between the input description and all the items in your dataset using the chosen similarity measure (e.g., cosine similarity).Rank the items based on their similarity scores to generate a ranked list.

Link Retrieval

Retrieve the links associated with the top-ranked items from your dataset.Return the ranked list of links as the output of your model.

Deployment

Deploy your machine learning model as a service or integrate it into an application where users can input their clothing item descriptions and receive the ranked list of links to similar items.
